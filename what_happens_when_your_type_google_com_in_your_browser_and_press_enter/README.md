# What Happens When You Type `https://www.google.com` in Your Browser and Press Enter?

This project is a deep-dive exploration of the systems and protocols involved when you make a simple web request — such as visiting `https://www.google.com`. The objective is to understand what goes on behind the scenes from the moment you hit "Enter" to when the page loads.

## 📌 Blog Post

I’ve written a comprehensive blog post explaining each step of the process, including:

- DNS Resolution
- TCP/IP & Port Communication
- HTTPS & SSL/TLS Encryption
- Firewall Filtering
- Load Balancer Distribution
- Web Server Handling
- Application Server Logic
- Database Interaction

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Understanding the end-to-end request process is essential for anyone working in:

- Front-End / Web Development
- Back-End Engineering
- Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
- Networking & Security
