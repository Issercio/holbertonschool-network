# Holberton School Network Basics

This repository contains Bash scripts related to basic networking concepts and tasks. The goal is to practice fundamental networking protocols, including ICMP, TCP, UDP, and more, by interacting with the system's network interfaces.

## Project Tasks

### 0. OSI Model
In this task, you will answer multiple-choice questions about the OSI model and its layers. The OSI model is a conceptual framework used to understand network interactions in seven layers, from physical transmission to application-level communication.

### 1. Types of Network
This task involves answering questions about different types of networks like LAN, WAN, and the Internet. You'll learn about how they connect devices and their purposes.

### 2. MAC and IP Addresses
Answer questions related to MAC (Media Access Control) and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses. These two are fundamental in networking, with MAC addresses uniquely identifying network interfaces and IP addresses assigning devices to a network.

### 3. UDP and TCP
This task focuses on the differences between the UDP and TCP protocols. You'll answer multiple-choice questions about how they transfer data and how they behave during communication, with specific reference to their speed, reliability, and use cases.

### 4. TCP and UDP Ports
You will learn about TCP/UDP ports and how they function as windows and doors to a network device, allowing data to flow in and out of it. You'll write a script that displays all listening TCP and UDP sockets along with their associated PID and program names.

### 5. Is the Host on the Network?
This task involves writing a script that uses the `ping` command to check if a host (specified by an IP address) is reachable on the network. It accepts an IP address as a command-line argument and pings it 5 times to check connectivity.
